# tarotReaderAppSwift - Re-Wriitng the Tarot reader app in Swift

<h3>Going to make it one of my very first full fledged iOS app using:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Swift</li>
  <li>SwiftUI</li>
  <li>SwiftData</li>
  <li>Which seem obvious but I was remembering HTML as I was writing this so just wanted to make a list.</li>
</ul>
